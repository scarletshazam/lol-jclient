  * **Do you work with Riot?**
In my dreams!

  * **Do you work with Boompje?**
Nope.

  * **Do you get paid for time spent on lol client?**
No, I spend nearly all my free time on loljclient without any form of compensation.

  * **How can I help you make this client?**
If you're a programmer and want to help, great! I'm usually a bit sloppy with naming conventions and coding styles. I'm not perfect!

If not, any ideas or suggestions are appreciated. I don't have a Mac, if you're willing to be my guinea pig let me know!

  * **Where can I leave my suggestions?**
You can send me an email, message me on reddit or post in the subreddit.

  * **Why did you pick Java?**
I chose Java because I wanted this client to work on all OSs that can play league of legends.

  * **Why should I use this client instead of the default client?**
This is open source and has some features that the default client doesn't have?

  * **Hey, is my password safe?**
Your password doesn't get used for anything besides logging in to the XMPP client (friends chat) and into the login servers. After that your password is removed from memory.

  * **Why does this use so much memory?**
It's saving all calls in memory. I'll disable this in release builds.

  * **Your client is ugly!**
Sorry :( I'm not too good at the designing part.
