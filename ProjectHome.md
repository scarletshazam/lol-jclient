**Goal: Create a Java implementation of the League of Legends PVP.net Client.**

# This project has moved to [GitHub, and is being left here for historical purposes.](https://github.com/KolakCC/lol-jclient) #

### Why create an alternative client to the PVP.net client? ###
I decided to make one because I was fed up by the multitude of bugs. Hopefully lol-jclient will provide a bug-free version with more frequent updates.
